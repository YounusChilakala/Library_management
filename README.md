# Library_management
An online library management system offers a user-friendly way of issuing books and also
viewing different books and titles available under a category. This project is a recreation 
of a library management system on a much smaller scale and provides us insights into some
necessary data such as list of borrowers for a certain book, highest and least borrowed book,
library branch data pertaining to the books etc.
The project is done entirely in MySQL.
